This repository contains the code used for the Master's Degree dissertation in PPGEst - UFRGS. Global Variable Selection for Quantile Regression.

## How to use

### Simulate

#### Simulate data

Run the script passing the parameters for sample size and number of simulations.

```
Rscript Rscript_data_gen.R N nrep
```

It will generate a file called `data_N<>_nrep<>.RData` that you will use in the monte carlo. 

#### Get the simulation data used in thesis
Free github do not support very large files, so the simulated data X and Y are stored in: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWioTEkP5I3ujHJn6dYXXosAlJmtnl1L/view?usp=sharing
